# SHARK-DETECTION-
In this project i have tried to develop a neural network to detect shark in videos and images. This project is in python using openCV.
The accuracy of the model is around 65% and the model is trained on a dataset of 10,000 images in which 5000 images were of shark and 5000 images were of non-shark.The images were handcrafted and downloaded using urllib and beautifulsoup.
